= License Compliance Tool


When you are using open-source third-party software components, you have to conform to their license.
For most licenses, this means three things:

1. Attribute that you are using the component and mention its license
2. Make the source code of the component available
3. Include the license terms

While it is not particular difficult to fulfill any of these obligations, doing it manually can become quite tedious if you are using a lot of them.
An in our times, we _are_ using a lot of them - especially if you have a dependency management system like Maven or NPM at hand.

License Compliance Tool helps you to be compliant to license terms by creating a manifest of all used components including their license source code.

== Overview

image::Overview.png[]

1. Create a *Software Bill of Materials* (SBOM) for your source code.
2. Call the *Jenkins Plugin* in your build job to create a component manifest and download the license files.
You can *configure* several JSON data sources to improve data quality.
3. Add the component manifest and the license files to your delivery package (e.g. ZIP, WAR, MSI).

== Software Bill of Materials

The main input is a https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/sbom/[Software Bill of Materials] (**SBOM**) of the software project.
It must be in the https://cyclonedx.org/[CycloneDX] format.

It can be created manually, but if you are using a dependency management system, it is more convenient to let it be created for you.

The CycloneDX toolchain supports several dependency management systems, e.g. https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin[Apache Maven]
or https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-npm[NPM].
Take a look at their https://github.com/CycloneDX[GitHub page] for a complete list.

=== Global configuration

==== Component meta data
Use this setting to override existing or add missing attributes to the components of the SBOM.
This is especially useful when you use a SBOM generated from your dependency management system since the resulting data is often incomplete and incorrect.

Enter an URL point to a JSON file containing an array of metadata entries.
Each entry contains regular expressions that are matched against the `group` and `name` attributes of components.
At least one of these attributes need to be set.
Regular expressions follow the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Java style].
If both are set, both have to match.
The first matching entry wins, so order is important.

Entries have the following attributes:

|===
|Name| Type| Required?|  Meaning

|groupMatch
| String
| If nameMatch is not set
| Regular expression for the component's group

|nameMatch
| String
| If groupMatch is not set
| Regular expression for the component's name

| mappedName
| String
| Optional
| "Use this name in the component manifest. Otherwise `group.name` will be used."

| ignore
| Boolean
| Optional
| If set to `true`, the component will not be included in the manifest

| url
| String
| Optional
| Overwrite the URL in the manifest which points to a website where the component's source code can be retrieved.

|licenses
| Array of String
| Optional
| Replace the licenses defined in the SBOM

|attributionNotices
| Array of String
| Optional
| Add attribution notices, e.g. copyright statements. These are often defined in files called NOTICE or NOTICE.txt.

|comment
| String
| Optional
| Explanatory comment. Not used during processing. If you maintain these files manually you can use this field to document the purpose of the entry

|===

Here are some examples to illustrate what you can do with it:

- Combine all components from group `my.component` into a component named `MyComponent` and add a custom URL

[source,json]
----
{
  "groupMatch": "my\\.component\\.*",
  "mappedName": "MyComponent",
  "url": "https://github.com/my/MyComponent"
}
----

- Ignore component, e.g. because it is not a third-party component and need not be included in the manifest

[source,json]
----
{
  "groupMatch": "my\\.component\\.*",
  "ignore": true
}
----

- Override licenses

[source,json]
----
{
  "groupMatch": "my\\.component\\.*",
  "licenses": [
    "Apache-2.0",
    "LGPL-2.1"
  ]
}
----

==== License information
Use this setting to define licenses and URLs with the license texts. The URL needs to point to a JSON file containing an array of entries with the following attributes:
|===
|Name | Type | Required?|  Meaning

|name
|String
|yes
|Will be used for the component manifest as well as for the filename of the license file.

|url
|String
|no
|URL to which the license name will be linked in the component manifest. If empty, no link will be created.

|downloadUrl
|String
|no
|URL from which the license file will be downloaded. If not set, the file will be downloaded from `url`.
|===

==== License mapping
Different components often use different names for the same license. You can use this setting to define aliases for licenses. The URL needs to point to a JSON file containing an array of entries with the following attributes:
|===
|Name | Type | Required?|  Meaning

|alias
|String
|yes
|The name of the license in the SBOM

|canonicalName
|String
|no
|The name of the license in the license information
|===

=== Create manifest
This build step creates a component manifest file based on an input SBOM and the global configuration.

[source,groovy,title=Declarative pipeline example]
----
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Create manifest') {
            steps {
                componentManifest inputPath: 'input.json', outputPath: 'output.pdf', templateUrl: 'file://template.ftl'
            }
        }
    }
}
----

With the parameter `templateUrl`, you can specify a URL pointing to a custom FreeMarker template which is used to create the output. The parameter is optional.
If it is not set, the template from link:core/src/main/resources/de/medavis/lct/core/outputter/DefaultComponentManifest.ftlh[de.medavis.lct.core.outputter.DefaultComponentManifest.ftlh] is used.


=== Download licenses
This build step tries to download all licenses referenced in the input SBOM and the global configuration into the specified directory.
Download URLs are preferred over view URLs. If neither URL has been specified for the license, then nothing will be downloaded.

The downloaded files will have an extension depending on the content type of the URL's content:

|===
|Content type | Extension

|`text/plain`
|.txt

|`text/html`
|.html

|_other_
|_none_
|===

Be aware that this task might download harmful content. Bundling the downloaded files into your redistribution package could allow an attacker to plant
malware. To safeguard against that risk, add license URLs after a manual review to your license configuration and run the task with `failOnDynamicLicense` option.
It will then fail if it encounters a license that is not part of your license configuration .

[source,groovy,title=Declarative pipeline example]
----
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Create manifest') {
            steps {
                downloadLicenses inputPath: 'bom.json', outputPath: 'target/THIRDPARTY', failOnDynamicLicense: true
            }
        }
    }
}
----

== CLI tool
You can also run the tool as a standalone CLI tool.
This is especially useful when you want to test out changes to component or license metadata since you do not have to switch back and forth between Jenkins
and your development environment.
You can run the CLI tool using
[source]
----
java -jar license-compliance-tool-cli.jar
----

Examples:

* Create a component manifest from a BOM on a server with a template:
[source]
----
  java -jar license-compliance-tool-cli.jar create-manifest --in=htps://your.server.url/path/to/bom --out=manifest.html --template=htps://your.server.url/path/to/template
----
* Create a component manifest from a local BOM with metadata from a server:
[source]
----
  java -jar license-compliance-tool-cli.jar
    create-manifest
    --in=path/to/bom
    --out.manifest.html
    --licensesUrl=htps://your.server.url/licenses.json
    --licenseMappingsUrl=htps://your.server.url/licenseMapping.json
----
* Download licenses
[source]
----
  java -jar license-compliance-tool-cli.jar download-licenses --in=path/to/bom --out.manifest.html --template=htps://your.server.url/path/to/template
